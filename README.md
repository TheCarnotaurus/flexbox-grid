# flexbox-grid
A simplified Flexbox grid I created to fit in directly with Bootstrap3 to fill a need that Bootstrap didn't provide. It can be used as standalone as well. It does not do everything Flexbox can do, but rather does what Bootstrap3 grid can do, just Flexified.

It has been written using LESS. You can remove/change any variables that do not fit your needs
